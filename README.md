# Mike21-model-data-processing
Pre and post data processing for mike21 hydrodynamic and environmental model.

I have been self-studying the MIKE21 hydrodynamic and environmental modeling, and have explored some codes for data preprocessing and postprocessing. I have saved these codes here for reference by colleagues who may need them

At present, it mainly includes the extraction of boundary and water depth before modeling, the drawing of tide, velocity and flow direction verification charts, the affected area of oil spill simulation results, and the time and proportion of affecting the main sensitive areas.

Other contents will be supplemented as needed.
